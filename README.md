# Data Structures ðŸ§©

This repository contains some basic programs related to **Data Structures**. These programs are part of my journey to understand and implement fundamental data structures efficiently.

## Programs Included
- **Arrays**: Basics of arrays, insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.
- **Linked List**: Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists with operations like insertion and deletion.
- **Stack**: LIFO structure implementation using arrays and linked lists, along with basic operations like push, pop, and peek.
- **Queue**: FIFO structure implementation using arrays and linked lists, covering enqueue and dequeue operations.
- **Binary Tree**: Implementation of binary trees with basic traversal techniques (inorder, preorder, postorder).

## What Iâ€™m Learning
- How to efficiently implement and use different data structures.
- Understanding time complexity and space complexity associated with each structure.
- Strengthening problem-solving skills with real-world examples.

## Work in Progress ðŸš§
- **Hashing**: Implementing hash tables and collision resolution techniques.
- **Graphs**: Basic graph structures, traversal techniques (DFS, BFS).
  
Stay tuned for more updates as I explore advanced data structures and algorithms!
